# NFC Experience

*Description:* This will be a nfc project that will have 
- Users will scan a nfc tag on a product box
- This nfc tag will have a url to load with additional parameters such as: product type, product brand, product id
- We will be designing the experience that user will have once the nfc is scanned
- Users can scan nfc multiple times
- on first scan we will load a prdocy unboxing and welcome page
- on the second scan and scan after the first scan we will show a different page where user can get support for his device, learn about product features etc.
- To have that functioanlity, we need to store the parameters passed from url and store them in a database, I am thinking about supabase, so we can track the scan counts etc.
- The pages will be rich in animation, such as 3d Model loader and player for animations, parallax scroll mechanisms, video scrubbing etc.
- We also will be using a basic design system to store the brand colours, typography, icons etc.
